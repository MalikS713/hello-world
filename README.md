# hello-world


Hello my name is Malik Simon. I am a student at UNT in Texas. I am from Houston and yes I am still an Astros fan. This is the first commit that I am submitting and it is fairly exciting. I am new to coding and computer science, but I feel like this is going to be a very long beneficial relationship.
